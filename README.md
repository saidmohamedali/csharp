#### Scenario 1:

```csharp
Instrument[] instrumentTable = new Instrument[100] // Instrument is class
```

##### Is instrumentTable value type or reference type?

#### Scenario 2: 
```csharp
object[] objects = new string[10];
objects[0] = "hello"; 
objects[1] = new object(); `
```
##### What is wrong with this peace of code? 


Guest what, I find my self blocked on questions like these while challenging my self c# on-line assements.
I find many weak areas about my c# programming skills.

I decide to work on, but got frustrated not to find good articles which gather basics/advanced topics on c# programming so

I decide to create this project.

This project not aim to provide tutorials, but it will give for keys topics: summaries, references and sometimes peace of codes.
